            <p>
              We first opened back in 2018 at our main location in Carlsbad, CA. Our main location serves as a great source of
              fresh and locally grown produce. Inside, you'll find a store that is filled with all our amazing fruit, that is
              hand picked and stocked daily. We also offer a drink bar that allows customers to create their own fruit smoothie
              with up to 3 fruits to combine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our fruit smoothies is what really helped us grow and take that next step. This lead to us opening up our first food
              truck in Solana Beach, CA in 2019. This helped get more exposure to customers closer to San Diego and serves as a great
              midway point between San Diego and our main location. With business continuing to grow, we opened up our second food 
              truck location in San Clemente, CA in 2021. This location helps us get more exposure to the Los Angeles area, where
              we didn't recieve many customers from.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the expansion of our food trucks and popularity on the rise, we now sell our fruit to local farmers. We are now
              starting to use some national and international suppliers as well to help give even more customers access to our products!
              We believe everyone should experience great tasting fruit and drinks that are fresh and locally grown, as well as at an 
              price affordable!
