                    <p>I think this page does a great job showcasing the contrast design principle. It has dark colors in the background with different variations as its accent colors. They do a great job though making the text and each certification button pop with the use of white against the darker colors. The white border makes it easy to distinguish each box from the next. The white text and logos also makes each certification box easy to read, so you know which one you want to select!</p>

                    <p>I thought Tire Rack did a great job with the alignment design principle on their homepage. Right away, the centered horizontal alignment sticks out. All the text is centered within the page, even when you scroll further down. The logo is also nicely centered in the nav bar and uses the centered vertical alignment to make the nav bar have an organized look and feel to it (at least to me). The two button towards the bottom I think utilize the horizontal alignment well as they are perfectly centered with each other with centered text.</p>

                    <p>I think Zenni makes great use of Hick's Law with their filters. I have personally used Zenni's mobile website for ordering new glasses on mulitple occasions. I find their filters very straight forward and helpful in narrowing down the selection of glasses I want to look for. I never feel overwhelmed or distracted when trying to filter my results. Even within each filter, ecah option is clear and easy to find. This helps make my shopping experience a lot more smooth when shopping through their website on my phone!</p>
